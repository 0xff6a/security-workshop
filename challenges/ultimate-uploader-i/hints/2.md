Try looking at the URL for a download link. What path might you be able to
craft to download arbitrary files using that action? How might you need to
encode parts of the file name to exploit a potential vulnerability here?

Note that this vulnerability is relatively difficult to exploit in the browser.
Using a ruby script or `curl` invocation will likely be easier.
