You will need to *sign* your encrypted session data or the application won't
accept it. The signing key is generated with different parameters to the
encryption key, so you'll need to read code from
`ActiveSupport::MessageVerifier` to see how that key is generated.

One fiddly part of getting this to work is understanding the way the session
data is packaged. The encrypted session data gets base 64 encoded twice before
it's transported. You won't be able to generate a valid cookie without
understanding how `MessageVerifier` and `MessageEncryptor` work together.
