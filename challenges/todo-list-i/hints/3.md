This applications password reset functionality is broken because anyone can
easily craft valid password reset tokens for any user.

The password reset token is of the following format:

`email=email@example.com&expires=1234567890`

Where `email@example.com` is the email address of the user who's password we
want to reset and `1234567890` is a unix timestamp of when the token is to
"expire".

The password reset token gets base-64 encoded before being passed around in the
query string of the password reset link.

From there, the strategy for gaining access to the secret is fairly simple:

1. Craft a password reset token with email `j.osterman@watchmen.net` and expiry
   at some arbitrary time in the future.
2. Use the password reset token to reset the password of
   `j.osterman@watchmen.net`.
3. Log in as `j.osterman` with the new password and parse the secret out of the
   page.
