The trick to this challenge is that the session data is the `Marshall.dump`
output of any arbitrary Ruby object. Whatever content the session has will be
loaded with `Marshall.load` in the web application process. If you can find a
class that allows you to run arbitrary code on initialization, you can run
arbitrary code in the application via the session cookie.

It will be extremely difficult for you to figure this one out on your own. Your
best bet would be to google for how to get remote code execution on a rails app
using the session secret.
