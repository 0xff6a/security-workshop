Here's the code you'll need to complete this challenge:

In gem `activesupport`

* `lib/active_support/message_encryptor`
* `lib/active_support/message_verifier`
* `lib/active_support/key_generator.rb:21`

In gem `railties`

* `lib/rails/application.rb:158`
* `lib/rails/application.rb:186` onwards

In gem `actionpack`

* `lib/action_dispatch/railtie.rb:15` onwards

You can either re-implement what this code does to read the session or use it
directly in your exploit script.
