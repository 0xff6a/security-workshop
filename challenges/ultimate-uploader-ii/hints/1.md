Rails stores sessions in the cookie by default. Your goal in this exercise is
to decrypt the session, load it and read the secret out of it.

Here's a high-level strategy of how to do that:

1. Vist the running application and obtain a session cookie.
2. Use the vulnerability in the previous challenge to obtain the
   `secret_key_base`.
3. Use the `secret_key_base` to generate the encryption/decryption key.
4. Extract the relevant part of the cookie to decrypt.
5. Decrypt the session cookie, load it and index into it with 'secret'.

You'll need to do a lot of googling or spelunking in the Rails codebase to pull
this off.
