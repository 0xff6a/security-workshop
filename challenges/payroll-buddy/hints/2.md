The relevant fields on User are `manager` and `organisation_id`. To modify
these fields, you're going to have to submit values for them to a form that
accepts them in the application.

Remember that just because the UI doesn't present you with a form field,
there's no reason why you can't try submitting that field on a given resource
anyway.
