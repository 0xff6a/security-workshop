The "Edit account" form presents a mass assignment vulnerability that allows
you to upgrade your account to manager and change your users organisation.

Knowing that, a strategy for completing this challenge would be to:

1. Create a new account
2. Use the edit account form to upgrade my account to manager
3. Iterate from 1 to 10000, set the users organisation_id and check the
   displayed organisation name against "The Daily Planet"
4. Once we find the right organisation, use the salary update form to modify
   "Clark Kents" salary, then parse the secret out of the application.
