The trick we're going to use in this application is called *ECB cut and paste*.

1. First we get the ciphertext for the token for user with email
   `k.osterman@watchmen.net` and base64 decode it. You can get this by signing
   up with that email address and initiating a password reset.
2. Do the same again with email `j.osterman@batchmen.net`.
3. Create a new token. The token should be the first 16-byte block of the token
   for user `j.osterman`, followed by all but the first block of token for user
   `k.osterman`.
4. Base 64 encode your new token and then use it to change the target users
   password as in the previous challenge.
