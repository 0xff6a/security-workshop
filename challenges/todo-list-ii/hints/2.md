Your goal in this challenge is to generate the ciphertext for the following
plaintext without knowledge of the key:

~~~
email=j.osterman@watchmen.net&expires=1234567890
~~~

You can't use the application to generate this exact ciphertext.

You could however get a password reset token that looks something like this when
decrypted (notice `k.osterman` rather than `j.osterman`):

~~~
email=k.osterman@watchmen.net&expires=1234567890
~~~

And then another one for this plaintext (`batchmen.net` rather than
`watchmen.net`):

~~~
email=j.osterman@batchmen.net&expires=1234567890
~~~

Once you've got those two ciphertexts, how might you put them together to get
your target ciphertext?
