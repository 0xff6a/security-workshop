This application exposes all secrets simply by modifying the URL.

For example, to view the secret with id 27, you simply need to point your
browser at `http://localhost:3000/secret/27`.

One strategy for finding the secret of the user with name "Bruce Wayne" would
be to iterate ids from say 1 to 10000 at the `/secret/#{id}` URL. Since the
page contains the name and the secret, all we'd have to do is stop if the
displayed name is Bruce Wayne, parse the secret out of the page and exit.
