You can run arbitrary JavaScript as an admin user thanks to an XSS
vulnerability. Because the application doesn't set cookies as HttpOnly, you can
acccess a users cookies from within JavaScript. This means you can steal an
admin users cookie and authenticate as them.

Here's one strategy for beating this challenge:

1. Set up a request bin at http://requestb.in/
2. Create a user with a name of a JavaScript payload that adds an image tag to
   the page with the `src` attribute set to your request bin URL with a query
   string of "?cookie=" + document.cookie.
3. Wait for the admin user to log in.
4. The user logging in and running the code should result in a request to your
   request bin. The request bin will display the data in the query string,
   including the value for the cookie that you set.
5. Set your cookie to that of the admin user and visit the application.
6. Parse the secret out of the page.
