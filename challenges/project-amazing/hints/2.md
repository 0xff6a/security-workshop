The `name` field on User is not properly escaped when displayed, so you can
inject javascript into it that will run when the admin user logs in.

You can now run some JavaScript as the admin user. How do you then log in as
the admin user? How might you be able to get data out of the admins browser
session? It might be worth reading through the section on "Hacker Tools" for
some ideas.
